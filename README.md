# Pokemon-Log-to-Replay
Convert from logs from Pokemon Online and Shoddy to replays from Pokemon Showdown

### Resources:
- [Showdown Replay Encoding](https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown/blob/master/sim/SIM-PROTOCOL.md)
- [Python RegEx Cheat Sheet](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-regex-cheat-sheet/)

### Plans
- [x] Turn a game into a replay by hand to explore how we would convert from log to replay
- [x] Choose a language to develop with (**Python** ~~or TypeScript~~)
- [ ] Start developing (currently testing RegEx patterns)
